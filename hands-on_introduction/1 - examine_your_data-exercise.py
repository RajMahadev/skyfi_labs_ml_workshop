#This exercise will test your ability to read a data file and understand statistics about the data.

#In later exercises, you will apply techniques to filter the data, build a machine learning model, and iteratively improve your model.

#The previous example used data from Melbourne. To ensure you can apply these techniques on your own, you will have to apply them to a new dataset (with house prices from Iowa).


import pandas as pd

#Step 1
#Read the Sydney train.csv file into a pandas frame called home_data

# Path of the file to read
data_file_path = 

# Fill in the line below to read the file into a variable home_data
home_data = 


#Step 2 
#Review the data

# Print summary statistics in next line
description = 

# What is the average lot size (rounded to nearest integer)?
avg_lot_size = 

# As of today, how old is the newest home (current year - the date in which it was built)
newest_home_age = 


#Think About Your Data
#The newest house was built quite long back
#How relevant is this data for current predictions?
